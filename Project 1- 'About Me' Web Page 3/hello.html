        <h2> "Call on a Friend"</h2>
        <p class="haiku"> I asked my friend for ideas for a Haiku, this was his response:</p>
        <p class="haiku"> I don't do poems <br> they cause me to be stressed out <br> but hence, here I am</p>

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>I like country music. This is, of course, very brave of me to admit. This past year I have listened to
            a lot of country which I never thought I would do because I have hated in my whole life.
            I love groups/artists like Sierra Ferrell, Zach Bryan, Muscadine Bloodline, Yola,
            Hailey Whitters, Flatland Calvary, Charles Wesley Godwin and more. I of course like lots of other
            types of music. I think it's important to note that the theme of this page is supposed to be
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2lIZef4lzdvZkiiCzvPKj7?si=Mmw6jf9gQMO33ge99dnqZw" target="_blank"
                class="secret-link"><b>brat</b></a> for those who couldn't tell.
        </p>
        <p>Like I said earlier I have been watching Rings of Power. I didn't think I'd like it because
            I had never really watched any of the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit but I enjoyed it so
            much. I'm really excited for the second season and I'm hoping it's good. To prepare my
            friends wanted me to watch the Lord of the Rings movies. I didn't really want to because
            I was holding a grudge that it didn't pass the <a href="https://youtu.be/7fshOP7x0GM?si=I98kSK583hNeUATV"
                target="_blank" class="secret-link">Bechdel
                test</a>. I watched the first two and
            I've really liked them so far! (I will, however, continue to hold my grudge).
        </p>
        <p>
            I love drag. I have only been to two or three drag shows in my life but I promise I'll work on that.
            I Trixie Mattel and Katya Zamolodchikova are my favorite queens and probably the most well known.
            I realize that not everyone has interest in it but is objectively so impressive how talented they are.
            They are simultanously actors, dancers, makeup artists, costume designers, comedians, and so much more.
            I think it is so fun to just be kind of absurd for no reason and I love it a lot!
